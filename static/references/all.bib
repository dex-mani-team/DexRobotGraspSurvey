  abstract = 	 {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d..  This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.}

  abstract = 	 {Dexterous manipulation with a multi-finger hand is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. While recent progress in imitation learning has largely improved the sample efficiency compared to Reinforcement Learning, the learned policy can hardly generalize to manipulate novel objects, given limited expert demonstrations. In this paper, we propose to learn dexterous manipulation using large-scale demonstrations with diverse 3D objects in a category, which are generated from a human grasp affordance model. This generalizes the policy to novel object instances within the same category. To train the policy, we propose a novel imitation learning objective jointly with a geometric representation learning objective using our demonstrations. By experimenting with relocating diverse objects in simulation, we show that our approach outperforms baselines with a large margin when manipulating novel objects. We also ablate the importance of 3D object representation learning for manipulation. We include videos and code on the project website: https://kristery.github.io/ILAD/ .}

  abstract = 	 {We propose a sim-to-real framework for dexterous manipulation which can generalize to new objects of the same category in the real world. The key of our framework is to train the manipulation policy with point cloud inputs and dexterous hands. We propose two new techniques to enable joint learning on multiple objects and sim-to-real generalization: (i) using imagined hand point clouds as augmented inputs; and (ii) designing novel contact-based rewards. We empirically evaluate our method using an Allegro Hand to grasp novel objects in both simulation and real world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first policy learning-based framework that achieves such generalization results with dexterous hands. Our project page is available at https://yzqin.github.io/dexpoint.}
